# Dual-Recommendation Disentanglement Network for View Fuzz in Action Recognition
This is the official PyTorch implementation of our work: "Dual-Recommendation Disentanglement Network for View Fuzz in Action Recognition".

In this paper, we present a novel approach and we define a new problem for Multi-view action recognition. We asses the performance of our method and previous state-of-the-art methods on N-UCLA and NTU-RGB+D datasets, We do some experimental analysis at IXMAS dataset.
